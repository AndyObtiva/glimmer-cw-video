# TODO

- Support Linux
- Consider enforcing use of Chromium browser (and perhaps pre-install it https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium https://github.com/scheib/chromium-latest-linux)
- Support customizing browser used by video widget (pass the option in)
- `muted` (true or false [default]): plays video muted at start (maps to video element defaultMuted attribute)
